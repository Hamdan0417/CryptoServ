Crypto Serv: The All-in-One Crypto Services Ecosystem - Technical README1. Project OverviewCrypto Serv is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a comprehensive, service-oriented ecosystem designed to address critical gaps in the blockchain and digital asset industry. Our mission is to build a trusted, centralized hub that connects talent, projects, investors, and service providers.This document outlines the full technical and functional requirements for building the Crypto Serv web platform. It is intended for the development team and provides a detailed roadmap for implementation.Live Prototype: A live, interactive prototype of the landing page can be viewed here. Note: This is a placeholder link.2. Core Platform Features (Functional Requirements)The platform will be a multi-faceted web application with several key modules.2.1. User Authentication & Wallet ManagementPrimary Authentication: Users must be able to connect their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) as the primary method of identification and login.Profile Creation: After connecting a wallet, users can create a profile.User Types: The system must support distinct profile types: "Talent" (Job Seeker), "Employer" (Company/Individual), and "Investor".Profile Data: Basic information (username, email), social links, and specific data relevant to their user type (e.g., CV for Talent, company details for Employers).Dashboard: Each user will have a personalized dashboard to manage their activities on the platform.2.2. The Job PortalFor Employers:Company Profile: Create and manage a detailed company profile.Post a Job: An intuitive form to post job openings with fields for title, description, location (including "Remote"), contract type, required skills, and salary range.Applicant Tracking: A dashboard to view, filter, and manage applications.Tiered Access: Employers may need to hold a certain amount of SERV tokens to unlock premium features.For Talent (Job Seekers):Professional Profile: Create a detailed profile, upload a CV (PDF).Job Search & Filtering: Advanced search functionality.One-Click Apply: A simple application process.Application Status: Track the status of job applications.2.3. Services MarketplaceProject Quality Certification: A submission form, an admin review interface, and a public registry of certified projects.Licensing Assistance: An informational page with a contact form.Support for Distressed Projects: An application form and a secure backend portal for evaluation.Investor Network Portal: An exclusive, token-gated portal for verified investors to view vetted opportunities.2.4. SERV Token Integration & Airdrop PortalPayment System: Use SERV for platform services with a discount mechanism.Staking & Loyalty Dashboard: A user dashboard to stake tokens, view rewards, and claim airdrops.2.5. Admin PanelA comprehensive and secure admin dashboard for user, job, and service management, airdrop configuration, and platform analytics.3. Recommended Technical StackFrontend: Next.js (React Framework) with Tailwind CSS.Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or NestJS).Database: PostgreSQL.Blockchain Interaction (Frontend): Ethers.js or Web3.js.Smart Contract Language: Solidity.Smart Contract Development Environment: Hardhat.Deployment: Vercel for the frontend, and a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku (Backend).4. Key Technical & Architectural Requirements4.1. Smart ContractsSERV Token: Must be a BEP-20 or ERC-20 compliant token following OpenZeppelin standards.Staking Contract: A separate contract for staking logic and reward calculation.Security: A professional, third-party security audit is non-negotiable before mainnet deployment.4.2. Backend & APIMust be built as a RESTful API.All endpoints must be authenticated and authorized based on user roles.4.3. Database Schema (High-Level)Users (wallet_address, username, email, profile_type, etc.)Profiles (linked to Users, contains detailed info like bio, experience, etc.)Companies (linked to employer Users)Jobs (linked to Companies, contains all job details)JobApplications (links a User profile to a Job)Services (e.g., Certifications, SupportRequests)Stakes (user_address, amount, timestamp)4.4. General RequirementsResponsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.Performance: Fast and optimized for quick load times.Security: Standard web security practices must be implemented.5.
